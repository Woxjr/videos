Why Rutgers can cover
Steve Pikiell's squad hasn't been to the NCAA Tournament since 2022, but the Scarlet Knights had high hopes of returning to March Madness after signing five-star freshmen Dylan Harper and Ace Bailey. That pair has been as advertised, with Bailey averaging 20.1 points and 7.9 rebounds per game while Harper is averaging 19.1 points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.1 assists.

However, Rutgers hasn't gotten a lot of production from the rest of its roster. No other player is averaging more than 7.2 points per game and the Scarlet Knights will likely need to go on a big run to earn tourney consideration as an at-large. They have managed to cover the spread in six of their last seven games and won outright as underdogs over Illinois and Northwestern the last two Wednesdays. See which team to pick here. 

Why Maryland can cover
Meanwhile, Kevin Willard and the Terps are rebounding nicely after enduring a sub-.500 season in 2023-24. Freshman center Derik Queen has provided a big boost for Maryland, as he's averaging 15.0 points, 8.3 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.0 blocks per game. 

The Terrapins are coming off a 73-70 loss to Ohio State on Thursday, but Julian Reese did manage a double-double with 24 points and 13 rebounds. Prior to the loss, Maryland had won six of its previous seven games and the program has also won 12 of its last 17 games against the Scarlet Knights. See which team to pick here.
